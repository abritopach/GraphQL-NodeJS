# GraphQL-NodeJS Server

GraphQL server in Node.js using Express, Babel, MongoDB and Mongoose.

This project has been developed to practice my skills with the tech stack shown above.

## Running


```bash
npm install
npm start
```

## Requirements

* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/) 

A MongoDB instance running locally (sudo mongod) is required to run any of the user related queries and mutations.


## Graphql examples

* Blog (blog folder --> graphql-nodejs/graphql/blog).
* Pokemon (pokemon  --> graphql-nodejs/graphql/pokemon).

## Test

We can see it in action by sending a POST request to our server and sending the query as the request body:

*Pokemon request examples*

* curl -XPOST -H 'Content-Type:application/graphql'  -d '{ pokemon { name } }' http://localhost:3000/graphql
* curl -XPOST -H 'Content-Type:application/graphql'  -d '{ user(name: "Ana") { name, caught, created } }' http://localhost:3000/graphql
* curl -XPOST -H 'Content-Type:application/graphql'  -d 'mutation M { newUser(name: "Paco") { name, caught, created } }' http://localhost:3000/graphql
* curl -XPOST -H 'Content-Type:application/graphq'  -d 'mutation M { caughtPokemon(name: "Juan" pokemon: "Snorlax") { name, caught, created } }' http://localhost:3000/graphql
